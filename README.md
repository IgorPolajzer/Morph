# Morph – AI-Powered Personal Growth App

Morph is a cross-platform mobile application focused on structured self-improvement. The project began as a **diploma thesis** and is being developed toward a public release on **Google Play Store** and **Apple App Store** in 2026.

Morph generates personalized growth plans using AI, tracks progress, and visualizes consistency through a simple in-app representation (a tree avatar). It integrates task management, habit tracking, and a calendar for planning.

## Project Context

Morph was developed to explore the combination of AI personalization, structured task planning, and visual progress feedback. The design and technical choices are documented in the diploma thesis:  

[**Igor Polajzer, “Development of the mobile application Morph”, 2025**](https://dk.um.si/IzpisGradiva.php?id=94126&lang=slv)

The thesis includes the rationale behind AI integration, behavioral design considerations, and architecture decisions.
